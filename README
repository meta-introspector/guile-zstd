Guile-zstd: GNU Guile bindings to the zstd compression library
==============================================================

This directory contains Guile bindings to the zstd compression library:

  https://facebook.github.io/zstd

You can authenticate the code in this repository by running:

  guix git authenticate \
    afe022f7a1de5517dfeae66705dc21d94f4d2b0a \
    3CE464558A84FDC69DB40CFB090B11993D9AEBB5

The command silently exits with zero on success, and errors out
otherwise.  We recommend invoking it from ‘.git/hooks/pre-push’.

Please report bugs to <guile-user@gnu.org>.
