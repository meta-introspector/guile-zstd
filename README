#+TITLE: Guile-zstd: GNU Guile bindings to the zstd compression library

This directory contains bindings to the zstd compression library for
GNU Guile 3.0, 2.2, and 2.0:

  https://facebook.github.io/zstd

Zstd (or “zstandard”) offers high compression ratios (close to lzip or
xz) and a very high decompression throughput.

These bindings provide a high-level port interface for in-process
compression and decompression.  Here’s how you would compress a file and
store its result on disk:

#+begin_src scheme
  (use-modules (zstd)
	       (rnrs io ports))

  ;; Create a compressed archive.
  (call-with-output-file "compressed.zst"
    (lambda (port)
      (call-with-zstd-output-port port
	(lambda (port)
	  (define data
	    ;; Read the input file in memory.
	    (call-with-input-file "input-file.txt"
	      get-bytevector-all))

	  ;; Write data to PORT.
	  (put-bytevector port data)))))
#+end_src

Decompression works similarly:

#+begin_src scheme
  (call-with-input-file "compressed.zst"
    (lambda (port)
      (call-with-zstd-input-port port
	(lambda (port)
	  ;; Read decompressed data from PORT.
	  ...))))
#+end_src

* Installing

With GNU Guix, you can install Guile-zstd straight of this source tree
by running:

#+begin_src sh
  guix package -f guix.scm
#+end_src

See the =INSTALL= file for instructions on how to build from source
manually.

* Hacking

Using GNU Guix, you can enter a development environment by running:

#+begin_src sh
  guix environment -CP -l guix.scm
#+end_src

You can authenticate the code in this repository by running:

#+begin_src sh
  guix git authenticate				\
    afe022f7a1de5517dfeae66705dc21d94f4d2b0a	\
    3CE464558A84FDC69DB40CFB090B11993D9AEBB5
#+end_src

The command silently exits with zero on success, and errors out
otherwise.  We recommend invoking it from ‘.git/hooks/pre-push’.
